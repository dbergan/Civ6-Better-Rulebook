('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_MOVEMENT_5_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '{LOC_BR_HEADER}"Embark" means to go onto a boat, literally coming from Latin, "on the wood". (Which is similar to our word "onboard".)  At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move into coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark; and after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To embark you simply move the unit from a shore tile to an adjacent coastal tile... unless there is a cliff between the two. Embarking is like moving onto a tile with a movement cost of 3... it takes 3 movement points (or all your movement points if the unit has fewer than 3). However, moving from a coastal city to the water, or onto a Harbor tile, only costs 1. Once the unit is embarked, it instantly changes its total movement capacity (the denominator on the unit''s card) to reflect the embarked movement. Early in the game this starts at 3, and so embarking can consume all of the unit''s movement even if it had 4 or more movement points on the shore tile. For example, with just the Shipbuilding technology, a Horseman on the shore could show 4/4 movement and then that''s reduced to 0/3 on the water. This means that its 4 movement points were first converted to 3 (its max embarked movement capacity) before subtracting the 3 for making the move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the game goes on, technology and wonders can increase the movement capacity for embarked units, and then our 4/4 Horseman would be 1/4 or 1/5 after moving to the water. Unit [ICON_Promotion]Promotions that increase movement usually also increase embarked movement (e.g. "Commando" for Melee, "Pursuit" for Light Cavalry, "Redeploy" for Anti-Cavalry, "Dancing Crane" for Warrior Monks). And some units have promotions that allow them to "ignore" the embarking movement cost (e.g. "Amphibious" for Melee units) which in truth just reduces the cost to 1 movement point instead of 3 to move from shore to water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disembarking (coming ashore) has a similar set of rules... where your unit''s movement capacity on land is instantly applied as soon as you come ashore (which may result in losing movement points like the Horseman example earlier). The movement cost for disembarking depends on the tile''s inherent movement cost. Coming ashore on hills or marsh will take 2 movement vs 1 on a flat desert or grassland tile. And to the tile''s normal movement cost, you need to add 2 more movement points. However, if the water tile the unit is on is within somebody''s borders, there isn''t an additional cost, it''s just like moving onto that tile as if you were on land. What matters here is the water tile the unit is coming from, **not** the land tile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embarked land units are considered to be in a transport ship, and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. They have reduced combat strength and (like naval units) can only heal in friendly waters.', 'en_US'),

('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_9_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '{LOC_BR_HEADER}CITY DEFENSE[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each city inherently has 200 health, twice that of combat units. When a melee attack causes a city to lose all of its remaining health, it is captured by the attacker. Like a military unit, a city defends with a certain [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength, which is calculated as follows.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First, your City Base Strength is determined by the [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength (not the [ICON_Ranged] Ranged, [ICON_Bombard] Bombard, or [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air Strength) of the strongest land or sea unit ever built, upgraded to, or purchased by your civilization, minus 10. (Air units and Giant Death Robots do not apply.) This number applies across your civilization, and once this Base Strength is raised, it can never be lowered, even if you lose all of your units. Bonuses from [ICON_Promotion] promotions, [ICON_Corps]corps/fleets, [ICON_Army]armies/armadas, policies, governments, religions, wonders and other modifiers do not normally affect your City Base Strength.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, there are a couple of quirks involving corps/armies/fleets/armadas. First, if you discover the tech for a new unit with a [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength that would increase your City Base Strength... but decide to build a Corp/Army outright (with a Military Academy) rather than a single unit, you actually will not increase your City Base Strength at all... you must build a single unit. Second, if you have an existing corp/army (and the Nationalism/Mobilization civic) and **upgrade** it to a new type of unit, it will apply not just the new unit''s Combat Strength, but also the +10/+17 from the corp/army to your City Base Strength. (This is an important trick to get exceptionally high city defense.)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Several modifiers are added to this City Base Strength to calculate the City Defense Strength, such as:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Palace Guard" (a free bonus for your capital)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Ideal Terrain" (when the city''s on a hill)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 River Defense" (when a unit is using a melee attack across a river)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+2/4/6/etc from Districts" (each of the city''s un-pillaged districts adds +2)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" (for Ancient/Medieval/Renaissance Walls, in addition to reducing incoming damage; more on walls later)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 {LOC_GOVERNOR_PROMOTION_REDOUBT_NAME} {LOC_GOVERNOR_DESCRIPTOR_PREVIEW_TEXT}{LOC_BR_LABEL}" (Victor is the active governor of this city)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+6 {LOC_POLICY_BASTIONS_NAME} {LOC_POLICY_DESCRIPTOR_PREVIEW_TEXT}{LOC_BR_LABEL}" (Bastions is an active military policy in the defender''s government)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"-X Damage to city/encampment" (Damage to city health causes it to be weaker. Starting at 198/200, X is 0.1 and then drops another 0.1 for each additional 2 damage to a max of 10. The damage modifier is rounded to the nearest integer, but only for the preview. The actual calculation considers the decimal.)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+X Garrisoned [UnitName]"[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Any garrisoned land or sea unit that has a higher [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength than your City Base Strength will bring the city''s defensive Combat Strength up to match its own. Again only [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength matters, not [ICON_Ranged] Ranged, [ICON_Bombard] Bombard, or [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that in the case of a **garrisoned** unit, the bonuses from [ICON_Corps]corps/fleets and [ICON_Army]armies/armadas always apply (but not other modifiers, like promotions or policies). X will be the difference between the city''s strongest garrisoned unit and the civilization''s City Base Strength. Additional garrisoned units don''t affect the city''s defense, so if you have both a land and a sea unit in the city, only the one with the higher [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength counts.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, it should be mentioned that land ranged units (Slingers, Archers, etc.) inherently do 17 less [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength against cities. (This does not include the Siege units like Catapults and Bombards.) Unlike the modifiers listed above, this is found on the attacker''s side of the combat preview panel.', 'en_US'),
('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_9_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_2', 'WALLS[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City walls grant a number of defensive benefits:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city gets the "+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" mentioned above to enhance your city''s defensive [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city gets a separate 100 health for just its wall. This upgrades to 200 health with Medieval Walls and 300 health with Renaissance Walls.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Researching Steel unlocks Urban Defenses, which instantly gives all your cities 400 wall health. Ancient, Medieval, and Renaissance Walls can no longer be built, but they still provide the "+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" bonus.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city''s health is "shielded" by the wall''s health percentage at the beginning of the attack. This means that if the wall is at, say, 140/200 before an attack (70%), the attack will only do 30% of its normal damage to the city health.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]When a unit attacks a city, it deals damage to both the wall and the city health simultaneously, each as its own attack (however, a unit making a melee attack will only take return damage once). The damage to the wall may be modified by the following points.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]All melee attacks do 85% less damage to the wall[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]All ranged attacks do 50% less damage to the wall[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Bombard attacks (e.g., Catapults) do full damage to the wall[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Damage to a wall cannot be more than 200 in a single attack[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]If a Battering Ram is adjacent to a city with Ancient Walls, Melee class units (Warriors, Swordsmen) and Anti-Cavalry class units (Spearmen, Pikemen) ignore the 85% reduction. Melee attacks from Cavalry units (Horsemen, Knights) do not get a benefit from Battering Rams.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]If a Siege Tower is adjacent to a city with Ancient or Medieval Walls, Melee class units (Warriors, Swordsmen) and Anti-Cavalry class units (Spearmen, Pikemen) ignore the "shield" effect of the wall and do their full normal damage to the city''s health.

(Again, Air units and Giant Death Robots do not apply.) Note that there is no -10 applied this time... it matches the strongest Ranged Strength value exactly. Again, this number is applied across the civilization, and once raised, it can never be lowered. Same as before, bonuses from [ICON_Promotion] promotions, [ICON_Corps]corps/fleets, [ICON_Army]armies/armadas, policies, governments, religions, wonders and other modifiers do not normally affect your City Ranged Attack Strength. And the same quirks involving corps/armies/fleets/armadas apply again... building a Corp/Army outright does nothing, and upgrading an existing corp/army (when you have the Nationalism/Mobilization civic) will apply not just the new unit''s [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength, but the additional +10/+17.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are only three modifiers that apply to City Ranged Attacks. One is visible (and bugged), the second is invisible, and the third might not even work. The visible one is:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 {LOC_POLICY_BASTIONS_NAME} {LOC_POLICY_DESCRIPTOR_PREVIEW_TEXT} (also {LOC_POLICY_BASTIONS_NAME} added another +5 to the Base Strength){LOC_BR_LABEL}" (When Bastions is an active military policy in the player''s government)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]It''s bugged because without{LOC_BR_LABEL}, it would show up as "+5 Ranged attack bonus" and say nothing about how it invisibly increased the "Base Strength" number for the attack +5 also. When you disable Bastions, you lose the visible +5 modifier and the Base Strength is decreased back to your empire''s standard City Range Attack Strength.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The second modifier is a decrease to the City Ranged Attack when the walls are damaged. The preview for this modifier simply doesn''t exist, and{LOC_BR_LABEL} couldn''t add it. Regardless, the way it works is that that up to 9.9 [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength is decreased depending on what percentage of the walls has been damaged (e.g., if the walls are 20% damaged, you would lose 2 [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength from your attack). Even though the modifier itself is invisible, it is applied to the big number in the combat preview and makes up the difference between that number and what''s labeled as "Base Strength".[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The third modifier is a +2 [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength bonus after winning a military emergency. This has not yet been confirmed to work, though it may be that it expires when the next emergency finishes.', 'en_US'),

/*
Also City Ranged Strikes get +2 after emergencies.


[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Walls add extra protection to a city or Encampment, making it even more difficult to conquer. This protection is like armor, shielding the city from attacks. Melee units deal only 15% of their normal damage to walls, and ranged units deal only 50% of their normal damage. Only Bombard units deal 100% of their normal damage to walls, making them necessary to capture a fortified city. If the walls are damaged, they stop being as effective and the district''s health will start taking a little bit of damage with every attack. Walls can only recover health with a Project found in the city''s Production Queue, like repairing district buildings, that becomes available if the district has not taken any damage for 3 consecutive turns. Once a city has walls, it can make ranged attacks against enemy units using a "City Ranged Strength" stat.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The City Ranged Strength is based on the [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength of the strongest ranged unit built by your civilization.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city gets additional bonuses to its City Combat Strength for each non-pillaged district it has, making big cities harder to capture, and from terrain and a few other modifiers sources.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities can also be under siege from attacking units. The City Center and other defensible districts like the Encampment are considered under siege if all 6 tiles around them are occupied by enemy units, under enemy Zone of Control, or are impassable due to mountains or Natural Wonders. In these circumstances, the district will not recover lost health, instead of healing automatically every turn as normal.

('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_12_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '{LOC_BR_HEADER}There are two kinds of formations. The first is an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation, which is when a civilian or support unit attaches to a combat unit and they temporarily move together. For example, you can have a Settler, Battering Ram, and Great General on the same tile as a Horseman. The Horseman will then have the option of forming an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation with any of those three units. If you create an Escort Formation with, say, the Settler, then as you move your Horseman, the Settler moves with it and is protected from being on its own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two [ICON_Promotion] promotions are affected by Escort Formations. The first is "Escort Mobility" for Light Cavalry units (like the Horseman), which gives its movement speed to the units it''s attached to. In our example, it would give the settler a speed increase. The other promotion is "Convoy" for Naval Melee units (like a Galley or Caravel), which gives the naval unit +10 [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength as long as it''s in an Escort Formation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other kind of formation is a Military Formation, which is when two adjacent units of the same type combine into one stronger unit. This is first available later in the game at the Nationalism civic. Nationalism allows a player to combine any two land combat units into a [ICON_Corps] corps, or any two sea units into a fleet.

[Dead if no open air bases?][NEWLINE][NEWLINE]From its air base, your combat aircraft has the following options:[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Attack a Priority Target within your aircraft''s attack range (attacking a support unit like a Supply Convoy or Drone that shares the same tile as a combat unit)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Make an Air Attack within your aircraft''s attack range (pillage a tile, but without gaining the yield [Bombers only]; or attack the city/combat unit on a tile)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Make a WMD Strike within your aircraft''s attack range [Bombers only] (drop a Nuclear/Thermonuclear Bomb)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Deploy to a visible friendly/neutral tile near the air base [Fighters only] (station on a tile to intercept enemy aircraft on that tile and all adjacent tiles; uses the aircraft''s movement range as a max radius from the air base, but can only travel as much as the movement range in one turn)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Re-Base (move to a new air base within 2x the unit''s movement range from the unit''s location)[NEWLINE][NEWLINE][ICON_You]Rest and Repair[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Each of these actions takes your full movement.{LOC_OT_HEADER}Air units do not move around the map like ground and naval units. They must be "based" somewhere. The City Center can always hold one air unit, but building an Aerodrome, Airstrip, or Aircraft Carrier can increase your available slots. The Aerodrome can have up to 8 slots, the Airstrip 3, and the Aircraft Carrier begins with 2 but can gain more through promotions.', 'en_US'),

note that a solo builder cannot be killed a air units, and how... they will even protect the Aluminum mine beneath them from air pillaging!!!
Can only bombers pillage?
For a bomber-pillage to succeed, does the plane need to survive the AA with more than 50% health?

('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_AIRCOMBAT_4_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '{LOC_BR_HEADER}Fighters can be deployed to any visible friendly/neutral tile within range of their air base tile. This range is determined by the Fighter unit''s movement range and is subject to bonuses like Logistics when the Fighter unit itself is in friendly territory. However, if a Fighter is deployed on, say, the westmost extreme of an air base''s range, it can''t redeploy to the eastmost extreme in one turn; it can only re-deploy as far east as the unit''s movement allows.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once deployed, the aircraft will fly a circular pattern around its Air Protection Range, which includes the tile it was deployed to and each adjacent tile. The Fighter''s ''Deploy'' operation persists from turn-to-turn until the player gives it a new command, similar to the ''Sleep'' and ''Fortify'' unit operations for land units. While deployed, the Fighter will defend against all air attacks, air pillage attempts, and [?nuclear strikes from Silos, Bombers, Subs, Heavy Howitzers?] within its Air Protection Range. Furthermore, enemy land units cannot move onto the deployed tile (i.e. the center tile of the Air Protection Range).
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Even though it''s deployed, a Fighter can still make Air Attacks and Priority Target attacks against enemies within its attack range from the deployed tile. This means that by using Deploy on one turn and an attack command on the next, a Fighter can actually reach targets quite far from its air base. The total distance is the Fighter''s movement range (deploy) + its attack range, i.e. basically double its attack range.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]However, the Deployed Fighter won''t show up in the normal unit cycle (similar to a Fortified land unit), so you must specifically click on it to make an attack. Immediately after the attack, the Fighter returns to its deployed tile and resumes Air Protection.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Fighters don''t heal while deployed (unless you have the Ground Crew [ICON_Promotion] promotion). To heal, you need to leave Deployed mode via the Re-Base operation, which ends the Fighter''s Air Protection. 


{LOC_OT_HEADER}Fighter aircraft can be deployed to a valid hex within their [ICON_Movement] Movement range from a friendly air base. After it is deployed, the aircraft will begin flying an orbiting pattern around its effective intercept range (currently 1 hex radius). This should make it more clear to both the attacker and defender the status of the Fighters in the Patrol state.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The Patrol state is continuing, somewhat like the ''Fortify'' unit operation. Once an aircraft has been set to Patrol it will do so until it is ordered otherwise or it is destroyed. While Patrolling, the aircraft will continue to intercept and defend against multiple attackers.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At any time during the player''s turn, Fighter aircraft can ''Return to Base'' (station at a friendly air base) in order to heal. Aircraft stationed at an air base do not intercept attacking aircraft. Aircraft can heal at the end of the game turn when stationed on a City Center, Aerodrome, Airstrip, or Aircraft Carrier only if they have not been involved in combat. Healing is ''fastest'' on an Aerodrome district, and less so on Airstrips and Carriers. These values can be increased through promotions and/or Policies.', 'en_US'),
