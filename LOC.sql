-- Embark details in Civilopedia
('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_MOVEMENT_5_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '***Better Rulebook***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Embark" means to go onto a boat, literally coming from Latin, "on the wood". (Which is similar to our word "onboard".)  At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move into coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark; and after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To embark you simply move the unit from a shore tile to an adjacent coastal tile... unless there is a cliff between the two. Embarking is like moving onto a tile with a movement cost of 3... it takes 3 movement points or all your movement points (if the unit has fewer than 3). However, moving from a coastal city to the water, or onto a Harbor tile, only costs 1. Once the unit is embarked, it instantly changes its total movement capacity (the denominator on the unit''s card) to reflect the embarked movement. Early in the game this starts at 3, and so embarking can consume all of the unit''s movement even if it had 4 or more movement points on the shore tile. For example, with just the Shipbuilding technology a Horseman on the shore could show 4/4 movement and then that''s reduced to 0/3 on the water. This means that its 4 movement points were first converted to 3 (its max embarked movement capacity) before subtracting the 3 for making the move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the game goes on, technology and wonders can increase the movement capacity for embarked units, and then our 4/4 Horseman would be 1/4 or 1/5 after moving to the water. Movement promotions usually also increase embarked movement (e.g. "Commando" for Melee, "Pursuit" for Light Cavalry, "Redeploy" for Anti-Cavalry, "Dancing Crane" for Warrior Monks). And some units have promotions that allow them to "ignore" the embarking movement cost (e.g. "Amphibious" for Melee units) which in truth just reduces the cost to 1 movement point instead of 3 to move from shore to water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disembarking (coming ashore) has a similar set of rules... where your unit''s movement capacity on land is instantly applied as soon as you come ashore (which may result in losing movement points like the Horseman example earlier). The movement cost for disembarking depends on the tile''s inherent movement cost. Coming ashore on hills or marsh will take 2 movement vs 1 on a flat desert or grassland tile. And to the tile''s normal movement cost, you need to add 2 more movement points. However, if the water tile the unit is on is within somebody''s borders, there isn''t an additional cost, it''s just like moving onto that tile as if you were on land. What matters here is the water tile the unit is coming from, **not** the land tile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embarked land units are considered to be in a transport ship, and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. They have reduced combat strength and (like naval units) can only heal in friendly waters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***Original Text***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move into coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark. And after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark. To embark a unit, move the unit to a coastal tile and then click on the "Move To" Action. Once embarked, the unit must move into water.[NEWLINE]Land units that embark are considered to be in a transport ship, and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. Embarked land units also suffer a reduced combat strength, and can only heal in friendly waters, making them much more vulnerable to attack from enemy naval units.', 'en_US'),

-- Formation details in Civilopedia
('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_12_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '***Better Rulebook***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
There are two kinds of formations. The first is an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation, which is when a civilian or support unit attaches to a combat unit and they temporarily move together. For example, you can have a Settler, Battering Ram, and Great General on the same tile as a Horseman. The Horseman will then have the option of forming an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation with any of those three units. If you create an Escort Formation with, say, the Settler, then as you move your Horseman, the Settler moves with it and is protected from being on its own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
Two [ICON_Promotion] promotions are affected by Escort Formations. The first is "Escort Mobility" for Light Cavalry units (like the Horseman), which gives its movement speed to the units it''s attached to. In our example, it would give the settler a speed increase. The other promotion is "Convoy" for Naval Melee units (like a Galley or Caravel), which gives the naval unit +10 [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength as long as it''s in an Escort Formation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
The other kind of formation is a Military Formation, which is when two adjacent units of the same type combine into one stronger unit. This is first available later in the game at the Nationalism civic. Nationalism allows a player to combine any two land combat units into a [ICON_Corps] corps, or any two sea units into a fleet. Then at the Mobilization civic, you can combine a corps/fleet with another unit of the same type to create an [ICON_Army] army/armada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
When you combine two units into a corps/fleet, the subsequent unit will have the following:
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The combined Healths divided by 2 (rounded down)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The promotions of the unit with more experience (if a tie in experience, the unit in the blue target is used)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]+10 [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength, +10 [ICON_Ranged]Ranged Strength, and +10 [ICON_Bombard]Bombard Strength. But NOT +10 [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air Strength.
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]+50% higher gold maintenance cost per turn
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]

Your cities'' defense is based on the strength of your strongest unit and Corps/Armies count for this.

Formations allow you to  move units together. This can be useful for escorting civilian units in hostile lands, or even creating stronger units in Corps and Armies. A military unit can create a formation with a support or civilian unit at any time. Naval military units may also create a formation with embarked land units. Support units, such as siege units, are most effective in battle when linked with another military unit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Starting in the Industrial era after completing the Nationalism civic, players will be able to unlock the ability to combine multiple military units of the same type into a single stronger unit. Two military units of the same type will be able to combine to create a Corps, giving them +10 to their base [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength. After researching Mobilization, three units of the same type may be combined into an Army, giving +7 to their base [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength. Keep in mind that their HP is NOT increased when units are combined in this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once a Corps or Army has been formed, the units may not be broken apart into individual units again. The experience and promotions of the highest experience unit is preserved when creating this type of formation, so it is beneficial to combine rookies with more experienced units. Naval units may also be combined into Fleets and Armadas.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***Original Text***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Formations allow you to easily move units together.
