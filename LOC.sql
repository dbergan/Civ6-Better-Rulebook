-- Embark details in Civilopedia
('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_MOVEMENT_5_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '***Better Rulebook***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]"Embark" means to go onto a boat, literally coming from Latin, "on the wood". (Which is similar to our word "onboard".)  At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move into coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark; and after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]To embark you simply move the unit from a shore tile to an adjacent coastal tile... unless there is a cliff between the two. Embarking is like moving onto a tile with a movement cost of 3... it takes 3 movement points or all your movement points (if the unit has fewer than 3). However, moving from a coastal city to the water, or onto a Harbor tile, only costs 1. Once the unit is embarked, it instantly changes its total movement capacity (the denominator on the unit''s card) to reflect the embarked movement. Early in the game this starts at 3, and so embarking can consume all of the unit''s movement even if it had 4 or more movement points on the shore tile. For example, with just the Shipbuilding technology a Horseman on the shore could show 4/4 movement and then that''s reduced to 0/3 on the water. This means that its 4 movement points were first converted to 3 (its max embarked movement capacity) before subtracting the 3 for making the move.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]As the game goes on, technology and wonders can increase the movement capacity for embarked units, and then our 4/4 Horseman would be 1/4 or 1/5 after moving to the water. Movement promotions usually also increase embarked movement (e.g. "Commando" for Melee, "Pursuit" for Light Cavalry, "Redeploy" for Anti-Cavalry, "Dancing Crane" for Warrior Monks). And some units have promotions that allow them to "ignore" the embarking movement cost (e.g. "Amphibious" for Melee units) which in truth just reduces the cost to 1 movement point instead of 3 to move from shore to water.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Disembarking (coming ashore) has a similar set of rules... where your unit''s movement capacity on land is instantly applied as soon as you come ashore (which may result in losing movement points like the Horseman example earlier). The movement cost for disembarking depends on the tile''s inherent movement cost. Coming ashore on hills or marsh will take 2 movement vs 1 on a flat desert or grassland tile. And to the tile''s normal movement cost, you need to add 2 more movement points. However, if the water tile the unit is on is within somebody''s borders, there isn''t an additional cost, it''s just like moving onto that tile as if you were on land. What matters here is the water tile the unit is coming from, **not** the land tile.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Embarked land units are considered to be in a transport ship, and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. They have reduced combat strength and (like naval units) can only heal in friendly waters.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***Original Text***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]At the start of the game, your land units cannot enter any water tiles. However, once you''ve learned the Sailing technology, Builders will be able to move into coastal water tiles. After Celestial Navigation, Traders will be able to embark. And after Shipbuilding, all units will be able to embark. To embark a unit, move the unit to a coastal tile and then click on the "Move To" Action. Once embarked, the unit must move into water.[NEWLINE]Land units that embark are considered to be in a transport ship, and do not have the same combat abilities as they do on land. Embarked land units also suffer a reduced combat strength, and can only heal in friendly waters, making them much more vulnerable to attack from enemy naval units.', 'en_US'),

-- Formation details in Civilopedia
('LOC_PEDIA_CONCEPTS_PAGE_COMBAT_12_CHAPTER_CONTENT_PARA_1', '***Better Rulebook***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]There are two kinds of formations. The first is an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation, which is when a civilian or support unit attaches to a combat unit and they temporarily move together. For example, you can have a Settler, Battering Ram, and Great General on the same tile as a Horseman. The Horseman will then have the option of forming an [ICON_Formation] Escort Formation with any of those three units. If you create an Escort Formation with, say, the Settler, then as you move your Horseman, the Settler moves with it and is protected from being on its own.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Two [ICON_Promotion] promotions are affected by Escort Formations. The first is "Escort Mobility" for Light Cavalry units (like the Horseman), which gives its movement speed to the units it''s attached to. In our example, it would give the settler a speed increase. The other promotion is "Convoy" for Naval Melee units (like a Galley or Caravel), which gives the naval unit +10 [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength as long as it''s in an Escort Formation.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The other kind of formation is a Military Formation, which is when two adjacent units of the same type combine into one stronger unit. This is first available later in the game at the Nationalism civic. Nationalism allows a player to combine any two land combat units into a [ICON_Corps] corps, or any two sea units into a fleet. Then at the Mobilization civic, you can combine a corps/fleet with another unit of the same type to create an [ICON_Army] army/armada.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you combine two units into a [ICON_Corps] corps/fleet, the new unit will:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have [ICON_Corps] two stars above its unit icon[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Be situated on the tile of the unit with more experience (if a tie in experience, the unit in the green target is used)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have the promotions of the unit with more experience (same tie breaker)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have a new Health created from the average of the two units[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have +50% higher gold maintenance cost per turn (than a standard unit)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have +10 [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength, +10 [ICON_Ranged]Ranged Strength, and +10 [ICON_Bombard]Bombard Strength (than a standard unit). But NO extra [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air Strength.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When you combine a [ICON_Corps] corps/fleet with a standard unit to make an [ICON_Army] army/armada, the new unit will:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have [ICON_Army] three stars above its unit icon[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Be situated on the tile of the unit with more experience (if a tie in experience, the unit in the green target is used)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have the promotions of the unit with more experience (same tie breaker)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have a new Health created from the average of the two units[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have +100% higher gold maintenance cost per turn (than a standard unit)[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Have +17 [ICON_Strength]Combat Strength, +17 [ICON_Ranged]Ranged Strength, and +17 [ICON_Bombard]Bombard Strength (than a standard unit). But NO extra [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air Strength.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Other notes:[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The unit''s health will still fall in the range of 0 to 100 (like standard units). Corps and Armies don''t get a larger HP pool like combined units in other civ games. However, because they have more [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength on all of their defenses, it will be harder to take their health.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Unlike an Escort Formation, a Military Formation cannot be broken apart into individual units again.[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Your cities'' defensive [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength is based on the strength of the strongest melee unit you have built, but Corps and Armies do not count for this.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***Original Text***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Formations allow you to easily move units together. This can be useful for escorting civilian units in hostile lands, or even creating stronger units in Corps and Armies. A military unit can create a formation with a support or civilian unit at any time. Naval military units may also create a formation with embarked land units. Support units, such as siege units, are most effective in battle when linked with another military unit.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Starting in the Industrial era after completing the Nationalism civic, players will be able to unlock the ability to combine multiple military units of the same type into a single stronger unit. Two military units of the same type will be able to combine to create a Corps, giving them +10 to their base [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength. After researching Mobilization, three units of the same type may be combined into an Army, giving +7 to their base [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength. Keep in mind that their HP is NOT increased when units are combined in this way.[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Once a Corps or Army has been formed, the units may not be broken apart into individual units again. The experience and promotions of the highest experience unit is preserved when creating this type of formation, so it is beneficial to combine rookies with more experienced units. Naval units may also be combined into Fleets and Armadas.', 'en_US'),

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City Defense
[NEWLINE]Each city inherently has 200 health, twice that of combat units. When a melee attack causes a city to lose all of its health, it is captured by the attacker. Like a military unit, a city defends attacks with a certain [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength, which is calculated as follows.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]First, a player''s City Base Strength is determined by the [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength (not the [ICON_Ranged] Ranged, [ICON_Bombard] Bombard, or [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air Strength) of the strongest land or sea unit ever built/purchased by their civilization, minus 10. This number applies across the empire, and once this Base Strength is raised, it can never be lowered, even if you lose all of your units. Bonuses from [ICON_Promotion] promotions, [ICON_Corps]corps/fleets, [ICON_Army]armies/armadas, policies, governments, religions, wonders and other modifiers do not affect your City Base Strength. To this Base Strength a number of modifers can be added to it for a particular city, like:
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Palace Guard" (a free bonus for your capital)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3 Ideal Terrain" (when the city''s on a hill)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 River Defense" (when a unit is using a melee attack across a river)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+2/4/6/etc from Districts" (each of the city''s un-pillaged districts adds +2)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" (for ancient/medieval/renaissance walls, in addition to giving the city extra health and reducing certain forms of incoming damage, more on walls later)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+5 Redoubt [BR]" (Victor is the active governor of this city)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+6 Bastions (policy) [BR]" (Bastions is an active military policy in the defender''s government)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"+X Garrisoned [UnitName]" (Any garrisoned land or sea unit that has a higher [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength than the player''s Minimum, will bring the city''s defensive Combat Strength to match its own. Again only [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength matters not [ICON_Ranged] Ranged, [ICON_Bombard] Bombard, or [ICON_AntiAir_Large] Anti-Air. Note, in the case of a **garrisoned** unit, the bonuses from [ICON_Corps]corps/fleets and [ICON_Army]armies/armadas apply (but not other modifiers). X will be the difference between your strongest garrisoned unit and the Minimum City Combat Strength. Additional garrisoned units don't affect the city''s defense, so if you have both a land and a sea unit in the city, only the one with the higher [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength counts.)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]"-X Damage to city/encampment" (Damage to city health causes it to be weaker. Starting at 188/200, X is 1 and then drops another 1 for each additional 20 damage to a max of 10.)
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Finally, it should be mentioned that land ranged units (Slingers, Archers, etc.) inherently do 17 less [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength against cities. (This does not include the Siege Units like Catapults and Bombards.) Unlike the modifiers listed above, this is found on the attacker''s side of the combat preview panel.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Walls
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City walls grant a number of defensive benefits:
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city gets the "+3/6/9 Wall Defenses" mentioned above to enhance your city''s defensive [ICON_Strength] Combat Strength
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city gets a separate 100 health for just its wall (this upgrades to 200 health with Medieval Walls and 300 health with Renaissance Walls)
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]The city''s health is "shielded" by the wall''s health percentage at the beginning of the attack. Meaning that if the wall is at, say, 140/200 before an attack (70%), the attack will only do 30% of its normal damage to the city health. After damaging the city health, then that unit automatically makes another attack that does normal (unshielded) damage to the wall, but takes no damage in return from this wall-attack. However, this second attack against the wall may be modified by the following points.
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]All melee attacks do 85% less damage to the wall
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]All ranged attacks do 50% less damage to the wall
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]Bombard attacks (e.g. Catapults) do full damage to the wall
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]If a Battering Ram is adjacent to the city with Ancient Walls, Melee class units (Warriors, Swordsmen) and Anti-Cavalry class units (Spearmen, Pikemen) ignore the 85% reduction. Melee attacks from cavalry units (Horsemen, Knights) do not get a benefit from Battering Rams.
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]If a Siege Tower is adjacent to the city with Ancient or Medieval Walls, Melee class units (Warriors, Swordsmen) and Anti-Cavalry class units (Spearmen, Pikemen) ignore the "shield" effect of the wall and do their full normal damage to the city''s health. Then they do a wall-attack at 85% reduced damage.
[NEWLINE][ICON_Bullet]If a Battering Ram and a Siege Tower are adjacent to the city with Ancient Walls, Melee class units (Warriors, Swordsmen) and Anti-Cavalry class units (Spearmen, Pikemen) ignore the "shield" effect of the wall and do their full normal damage to the city''s health. Then they do a wall-attack that ignores the 85% reduction.






[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]City Offense
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Walls add extra protection to a city or Encampment, making it even more difficult to conquer. This protection is like armor, shielding the city from attacks. Melee units deal only 15% of their normal damage to walls, and ranged units deal only 50% of their normal damage. Only Bombard units deal 100% of their normal damage to walls, making them necessary to capture a fortified city. If the walls are damaged, they stop being as effective and the district''s health will start taking a little bit of damage with every attack. Walls can only recover health with a Project found in the city''s Production Queue, like repairing district buildings, that becomes available if the district has not taken any damage for 3 consecutive turns. Once a city has walls, it can make ranged attacks against enemy units using a "City Ranged Strength" stat.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The City Ranged Strength is based on the [ICON_Ranged] Ranged Strength of the strongest ranged unit built by your civilization.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]The city gets additional bonuses to its City Combat Strength for each non-pillaged district it has, making big cities harder to capture, and from terrain and a few other modifiers sources.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities can also be under siege from attacking units. The City Center and other defensible districts like the Encampment are considered under siege if all 6 tiles around them are occupied by enemy units, under enemy Zone of Control, or are impassable due to mountains or Natural Wonders. In these circumstances, the district will not recover lost health, instead of healing automatically every turn as normal.

[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]When a city is captured.... units on the city tile die, are re-based, etc. New owner can instantly make a city ranged attack
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Miscellaneous
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that the number on the City Banner is close, but does not factor in "Ideal Terrain" or "Damage to city/encampment" modifiers.
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Note that air units do not add to a city''s defense. (Although if deployed, they can intercept incoming enemy aircraft.)
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Picky detail: If a scout attacks and has less combat strength....
[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Picky detail: Even when the walls are at full health, the city will take 1 damage


[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]***Original Text***[NEWLINE][NEWLINE]Cities may be attacked and captured by military units. Each city has a "City Combat Strength" stat that determines its strength when attacked by other units. The higher the city''s City Combat Strength, the more difficult it is to capture the city.
